### PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Most of the current university website pages are designed too complex with too many layers. 
Not being able to search for relevant information from the school's website instantly, students usually must ask by contacting advisors. 
However, advisors are required to make an appointment, which expands the difficulty for students to obtain general information quickly and boosts the advisor's workload. 
Thus, the unnecessary cost of energy and time for both parties, the students, and the school faculties, increased. 
In this paper, an AI-based chatbot for the University of North Texas (UNT) has been done.

### OBJECTIVE
This work aims to use deep learning and other AI algorithms to make a dialogue chatbot system. 
We have compared and studied various algorithms to assemble the chatbot. 
The Seq2Seq LSTM allows us to expand and apply this model to a mixture of Question-Answering (QA) tasks. 
In the beginning, we extracted all frequently asked questions (FAQs) from the UNT website, 
then used the Seq2Seq LSTM model with GloVe word embedding and different optimizations to gain accuracy as high as 50 percent on the dataset.
