- - What Is Environmental Justice?
  - Environmental justice resides at the intersections of environmentalism and social justice. To advocate for environmental justice means to work towards a fair distribution of environmental benefits and burdens regardless of people's race, income, national origin, or another demographic. 
    Although the EJ movement has gained mainstream recognition in the US in recent years, this movement takes myriad forms and has persisted for many years in communities across the globe. 
    Demands for EJ may emerge as mainly nonviolent, direct action movements. For example, communities who typically experience an environmental injustice, such as rampant deforestation or toxic waste contamination in their neighborhood, come together to defend their families and communities from these injustices.
- - What is the We Mean Green Fund?
  - The We Mean Green Fund (WMGF) provides funding for students, staff, and faculty members of the UNT community to make our campus even greener!

Each student contributes $5 to the Environmental Service Fee during the spring and fall semesters to support community-driven campus environmental sustainability projects.
- - What kind of projects can receive funding?
  - The We Mean Green Fund Committee selects projects that enhance student learning and campus life while addressing environmental sustainability topics such as waste reduction, energy and water conservation, transportation, community engagement and education, building efficiencies, landscaping, gardening, biodiversity, and more.
