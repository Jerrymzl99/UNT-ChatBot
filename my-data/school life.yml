Check your UNT email address for a notice or meeting request or meeting request from SCCS. It can take a few days for SCCS to review the police report, especially for referrals given to students over the weekend. 
- - I got cited or arrested by the police and I got a notice of complaint. Isn’t that double jeopardy?
  - No. Students are accountable to criminal and civil authorities for misconduct which violates the law. The same misconduct may also violate UNT’s Code of Student Conduct. UNT’s conduct process is separate from any criminal or civil legal action. 
- - What will happen at a meeting? What can I do to prepare?
  - You’ll meet with a SCCS representative who will want to talk with you about what happened. You’ll be asked for your perspective and if there is any information that SCCS should look at or anyone SCCS should talk to in order to make a well-informed decision about what happened.

Review is the opportunity to have a neutral, third party review Student Conduct and Community Standards decision. When the SCCS representative explains their decision they should also explain your option to request reconsideration or a review. Be sure to pay attention to the deadline.
- - Will this go on my record?
  - Student Conduct and Community Standards keeps student conduct records. These records are separate from a student’s transcript and other types of records UNT keeps about students. Student conduct records are typically kept for seven years, then they are destroyed. If a student's good conduct standing is permanently removed, they are suspended or expelled, then the record is permanently kept. Inside of UNT, student conduct records are only shared with employees who need to know information from the record in order to do their job. For example, residence hall staff would need to know if a student has been removed from a residence hall. Outside of UNT, information from a student conduct record is generally only shared with the student’s written, signed consent. There are some exceptions to this, which are explained in UNT’s FERPA Policy. 
- - How can I file a complaint against a student?
  - If you think a student has engaged in misconduct please contact the Dean of Students Office (940.565.2648 or conduct.dos@unt.edu) to make a report. If you believe a student has committed a crime you can also make a report to the UNT Police Department (940.565.3000) or the appropriate law enforcement agency. If you believe a student has engaged in discrimination, harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, relationship violence, or stalking you can also make a report to the Office of Equal Opportunity (940.565.2759, oeo@unt.edu).

- - Does UNT handle Employment Law?
  - You must get paid for the work you do. That's what both federal and state laws require. The Texas Work Force Commission is a great resource that helps people get you paid for the work they've performed. There are other ways of making sure you're properly compensated, and if you're not sure how to proceed, stop by our office. Texas is an at-will employment state, which allows employers to demote or fire someone for good cause, bad cause, or no cause at all. There is a limit, though – you cannot be treated differently on the basis of your gender, religious beliefs, medical condition (if you can still perform the essential duties of the job with reasonable accommodation), race or nation of origin. If you feel you've been treated differently in a way that has negatively affected your work status, document your situation and visit our office without delay. We can help you understand the necessary steps you need to take in order to take action.
- - Does UNT handle Debt Collection?
  - There are laws that debt collectors must follow. If someone collecting a debt from you breaks one of these laws, you have rights, and you can pursue legal remedies against that debt collector. For example, a debt collector cannot discuss your debt with someone else – not even your parents. If someone leaves a voicemail message saying that the call is concerning a debt, that's a violation. Frequent, repeated, harassing phone calls are illegal. Please visit our office if you ever get into this kind of trouble. We have helped many students resolve these problems.
- - Does UNT handle Auto Purchases?
  - Before you walk into a dealership prepare yourself with knowledge. Make sure you know what you are signing, and that the paperwork accurately reflects your understanding of the transaction. Only new cars are covered under the Texas Lemon Law, but there are other remedies available to those who are sold worthless vehicles. We recommend the People's Lawyer Consumer Newsletter from U. Houston's Law Center for the latest in consumer news.
- - Does UNT handle issues with Landlords & Tenants?
  - Landlord/tenant issues can be complex and frustrating to students. While most Denton County landlords provide affordable housing and good living conditions, there are times when students run into problems with their living arrangements and need expert help to understand their rights under both the Texas Property Code and their lease contracts. SLS offers free lease reviews for all students looking to rent an apartment for the 2020 - 2021 academic year. Contact SLS immediately if you receive a notice to vacate or other eviction paperwork. If you have already signed your lease and your landlord requests you to sign a COVID-19 waiver, contact our office to discuss. Below are the most frequent reasons that students visit our office for legal advice.
- - Does UNT handle Security Deposits?
  - Landlords are obligated to refund security deposits or provide an accounting within 30 days from the time a tenant vacates the property, unless the tenant owed rent or failed to provide written notice of forwarding address. Landlords may not deduct from the security deposit for normal wear and tear. Always read the move-out instructions before leaving the rented premises, and take pictures of the empty premises in case of a dispute over charges.
- - Does UNT help with Repairs?
  - Frequent calls to a property manager may not bring results quickly enough. Calling the office does not trigger the legal obligations of the landlord to repair under the property code and most lease contracts. If your problem does not get the immediate attention you believe it should, read your lease to find out what the landlord requires. If you need help with this, please see one of the lawyers here at SLS. Always call the landlord/property manager if you have a serious situation with flooding, fire, or other disasters that compromise your personal safety and/or the safety of the property.
- - Does UNT help with Evictions?
  - There is a process a landlord must follow under Texas law in order to successfully evict a tenant. The formal term for an eviction is "forcible entry and detainer," or FED, and the requirements are outlined in Title 4, Chapter 24 of the Texas Property Code. Any student who receives a Notice to Vacate should call our office and bring the notice with the lease agreement to the SLS office as instructed.
- - Can UNT help with my roommate situation?
  - Students often share apartment units with their friends or acquaintances. It's a good opportunity for social interaction and for many, it's a financial necessity. The best roommate is a person you know and trust. You may want to sign a short lease at first to see how things work out. Most leases call for "joint and several responsibility" for the rent. In other words, the landlord doesn't care who pays what, just that 100% of the rent is paid and paid on time. If your roommate leaves in the middle of the lease term, you'll still have to pay the full amount of monthly rent.
- - Can UNT help with my payment for Utilities?
  - You have 3 roommates, but only one name can be on the electric bills, so you volunteer. Now you have to split the bills 4 ways. You have to email or post notes to notify the others each month, providing deadlines which are sometimes forgotten or overlooked. You might end up paying double some months when a roommate is late. But what happens if a roommate leaves? The electric company wants their money, and you're the one on the hook. To avoid this financial hit to your bank account, you may want to sign up for Simple Bills. All roommates pay Simple Bills for utilities, and Simple Bills handles the rest. The benefit is that no one person is responsible for the entire monthly bill. There is a surcharge for using this service, but if you're rooming with strangers, consider it insurance. Learn more at http://simplebills.com.
- - Can UNT help with legal issues with Immigration? 
  - Student legal services will provide free legal services to currently registered students. Although immigration laws change frequently, the attorney will advise on U.S. Immigration Law, discuss eligibility requirements, and advise students on many immigration matters.
